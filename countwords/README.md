Sample code that can be used to count words in a text document. The project uses Python3.

## Running the code

1. Download the code
1. Replace `<FILE_NAME>` in `countwords.py` with path to a text document on your machine
1. Run `python3 countwords.py` from terminal

Once the process completes, the program will output number of empty and non-empty lines, along with max occurring word in the file. The word histogram can be printed by uncommenting the last print statement.
